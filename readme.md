# AE-oop — Playwright E2E tests for automationexercise.com

Automated end-to-end (E2E) testing suite for https://automationexercise.com built with Playwright and TypeScript. The project demonstrates a Page Object Model (POM) architecture, data-driven tests, and utilities for maintaining test data such as user credentials.

## Overview

This project uses Playwright's test runner for browser automation, the TypeScript language, and the Page Object Model pattern to keep UI interactions encapsulated and maintainable. The test suite covers user flows such as registration, login, product search, placing orders, and posting product reviews.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)
- A working internet connection (tests target automationexercise.com)

## Install

Open a shell in the repository root and run:

```powershell
npm install
npx playwright install
```

Notes:
- The second command installs Playwright's browser binaries. If you want dependencies + browsers in a single step, run `npm ci` / `npm install` followed by `npx playwright install`.

## Running tests

By default, the repo doesn't set `npm` scripts in `package.json`. You can run tests with Playwright's runner directly:

```powershell
npx playwright test
```

Run tests in headed mode (for visual debugging):

```powershell
npx playwright test --headed
```

Run a specific test file:

```powershell
npx playwright test tests/loginUsingJson.spec.ts
```

Run a single test (by title pattern or using `-g`):

```powershell
npx playwright test -g "Login using JSON data"
```

Run using a specific project (config defines `chromium`):

```powershell
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

Remove accidental `test.only` usage for full runs (CI may fail on `only` depending on config) or set `forbidOnly` to true in CI.

Optional helpful `package.json` scripts (add to `scripts`):

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "playwright test",
  "test:headed": "playwright test --headed",
  "test:report": "playwright show-report",
  "test:debug": "PWDEBUG=1 npx playwright test"
}
```

## Test report & artifacts

- The Playwright HTML report is generated by default and stored in `playwright-report/`.
- To view the most recent report locally, use:

```powershell
npx playwright show-report
```

The config also enables video recording for Chromium runs and may capture traces on retry. Check `playwright.config.ts` for configuration details.

## Project structure

```
├── pages/                # Page object classes (HomePage, NavbarComponent, etc.)
├── tests/                # Playwright test specs
├── test/                 # Utilities for reading JSON and example scripts
├── users.json            # Root-level test users JSON file (user store)
├── playwright.config.ts  # Playwright configuration
├── package.json          # Node dependencies
└── README.md             # This file
```

Key files and directories:
- `pages/`: Page object library used by tests
- `tests/`: Spec files run by Playwright
- `test/ReadJson.ts`: Utility file demonstrating JSON reading
- `users.json`: JSON file containing test user credentials (read/written by tests)

## Test data

- `users.json` (root) contains a list of test users with `email` and `password` and is used by `NavbarComponent` to add/read user credentials.
- NOTE: There is a mismatch in paths in code — some modules read `test/users.json` while others read the root `users.json`. If you see issues, either create `test/users.json` or update the path in `loginUsingJson.ts` to point to the root `users.json`.

## Debugging & tracing

- To run a test and pause the browser for debugging, set the Playwright debug mode:

```powershell
PWDEBUG=1 npx playwright test --debug
```

- View trace files with Playwright Trace Viewer if `trace` is enabled in `playwright.config.ts` (e.g., set to `'on-first-retry'`).

## Adding tests

1. Create a new spec file under `tests/` with a `*.spec.ts` suffix.
2. Create or extend a page object in `pages/` if the new test requires encapsulated UI interactions.
3. Use fixtures and Playwright's recommended patterns for clean setup/teardown.
4. Avoid leaving `.only` in tests — CI should fail the build if `forbidOnly` is enabled.

## Contributing

- Open an issue with reproducible steps for bugs or feature suggestions.
- Follow the repository's coding conventions and keep page objects responsible for UI interaction only.

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- If tests fail unexpectedly because the browser isn't found, run:

```powershell
npx playwright install
```

- If you encounter path errors when reading/writing `users.json`, unify the file location and update the paths accordingly. For this repository, `NavbarComponent.ts` writes to the root `users.json`, while `loginUsingJson.ts` currently tries to read from `test/users.json` — either create that file or update the path in `loginUsingJson.ts` to point to `../users.json`.

- If the site layout changes, update the page objects rather than modifying tests directly.

## License

This repository currently does not include an explicit license file; add one if you intend to share or open-source the code.

Happy testing! 💡
# AE-oop

This project is an automated end-to-end testing suite for [automationexercise.com](https://www.automationexercise.com/) using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and TypeScript. It demonstrates object-oriented design for page objects and test organization.

## Features

- User registration, login, and account deletion flows
- Checkout and order placement with registration or login during checkout
- Product review submission
- Data-driven login using JSON user data
- Modular page object structure for maintainability

## Project Structure

```
├── pages/         # Page Object Model classes (HomePage, NavbarComponent, etc.)
├── tests/         # Playwright test specs
├── test/          # JSON data files and utility scripts
├── users.json     # Registered users (for login tests)
├── package.json   # Project dependencies
├── playwright.config.ts # Playwright configuration
└── readme.md      # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

- Test reports are generated in `/playwright-report/`.

### Test Data

- User credentials are stored in `users.json`.
- Faker is used for generating random user data during registration.

## Key Files

- `pages/`: Contains all page object classes (e.g., `HomePage.ts`, `NavbarComponent.ts`)
- `tests/`: Contains test specs (e.g., `account.spec.ts`, `placeOrder.spec.ts`)
- `test/users.json`: Sample users for data-driven login
- `playwright.config.ts`: Playwright configuration (browser, reporter, etc.)

## Notes

- The project uses Playwright's test runner and expects the target website to be available.
- Some tests write to `users.json` to store new users for login scenarios.
- Video recording is enabled for Chromium runs.
